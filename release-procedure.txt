The docker images and Windows installers are official releases and shall be versioned consistently (they should share the same package numbers and same content).  
These packages are numberd by YY.M[.r] where YY is the year, M is the month and r is the release counter for this month (starting at 1).  


# Upgrading packages

Each time you want to release a new package (which means you'll upgrade the version of at least one component):

- search for `CHANGE_VERSION` in the whole repo and look for lines containing the component(s) you're upgrading -> upgrade the versions
- search for `CHANGE_VERSION` in the whole repo and look for the package version numbers -> upgrade with YY.M[.r]
- update the WindowsInstaller/Resources/README.txt with the new version numbers
- update the docker/README-dockerhub.txt with the new version numbers (keep the previous version package list in the readme)
- update the release-notes-docker-images.txt
- at this stage, you may commit and tag as explained before and let GitHub build the Docker images OR you may build manually with the commands below.
- notify S. Jodogne that a new Windows Installer is available so he can update the download link on the Orthanc page (note, since 22.3.0, the latest
  windows installer is always copied under ...latest.exe)
