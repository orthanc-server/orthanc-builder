The docker images and Windows installers are official releases and shall be versioned consistently (they should share the same package numbers and same content).  These packages are numberd by YY.M[.r] where YY is the year, M is the month and r is the release counter for this month.  When r is zero, it is not included in Docker images and in communication.

# Upgrading packages

This procedure is still very manual...  Each time you want to release a new package (which means you'll upgrade the version of at least one component):

- search for `CHANGE_VERSION` in the whole repo and look for lines containing the component(s) you're upgrading -> upgrade the versions
- search for `CHANGE_VERSION` in the whole repo and look for the package version numbers -> upgrade with YY.M[.r]
- update the WindowsInstaller/Resources/README.txt with the new version numbers
- update the docker/README-dockerhub.txt with the new version numbers (keep the previous version package list in the readme)
- update the docker/README-dockerhub-pro.txt with the new version numbers (keep the previous version package list in the readme)
- update the release-notes-docker-images.txt
- at this stage, you may commit and tag as explained before and let Jenkins build the Docker images or you may build manually with the below commands
- build the orthanc-builder image: `ciBuildOrthancBuilderImage.sh --no-cache`
- build the osimis/orthanc image: `ciBuildOsimisOrthancDockerImage.sh --no-cache`
- build the osimis/orthanc-pro image: `ciBuildOsimisOrthancProDockerImage.sh --no-cache`
- make sure the Docker image can be started `docker run --rm -p 8042:8042 osimis/orthanc:YY.M`
- commit your changes
- tag the repo with the package version `git tag -a YY.M -m "YY.M"`
- push to bitbucket (including the tag: `git push --tags` followed by `git push`)
- trigger a build of the Windows Installer
- download the Windows Installer and perform a smoke test (make sure it starts correctly)
- notify S. Jodogne that a new Windows Installer is available so he can update the download link on the Orthanc page
- update the links in osimis.io/source/localizable/download.html.erb
- tag the docker images with `latest`: `docker tag osimis/orthanc:YY.M osimis/orthanc:latest` and `docker tag osimis/orthanc-pro:YY.M osimis/orthanc-pro:latest`
- push the 4 images to Dockerhub: `docker push [osimis/orthanc:YY.M osimis/orthanc:latest osimis/orthanc-pro:YY.M osimis/orthanc-pro:latest]`
- connect to Dockerhub and update the documentation manually by copy/pasting the content of `docker/README-dockerhub.txt` into the project description (for both osimis/orthanc and osimis/orthanc-pro images)
