The docker images and Windows installers are official releases and shall be versioned consistently (they should share the same package numbers and same content).  
These packages are numberd by YY.M[.r] where YY is the year, M is the month and r is the release counter for this month (starting at 1).  


# Upgrading packages

Each time you want to release a new package (which means you'll upgrade the version of at least one component):

- search for `CHANGE_VERSION` in the whole repo and look for lines containing the component(s) you're upgrading -> upgrade the versions.
  Note: all version numbers shall be in build-matrix.json (except for Windows Installer !)
- search for `CHANGE_VERSION` in the whole repo and look for the package version numbers -> upgrade with YY.M[.r]
- update the WindowsInstaller/Resources/README.txt with the new version numbers
- update the docker/README-dockerhub.txt with the new version numbers (keep the previous version package list in the readme)
- update the release-notes-docker-images.txt
- at this stage, you may commit and tag as explained before and let GitHub build the Docker images OR you may build manually with the commands below.
- notify S. Jodogne that a new Windows Installer is available so he can update the download link on the Orthanc page (note, since 22.3.0, the latest
  windows installer is always copied under ...latest.exe and there's no need to update the Osimis website anymore)

All version numbers shall be changed in build-matrix.json (and in release-notes-docker-images.txt + README-dockerhub.md)
