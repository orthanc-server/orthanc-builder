# Description

This repo contains build instructions for the following components:

- the `osimis/orthanc` Docker image
- the Windows installer
- the OSX package (zip with Orthanc executable and plugins)

The Docker image is rebuilt from scratch (Orthanc and all its plugins are compiled during the build process).
