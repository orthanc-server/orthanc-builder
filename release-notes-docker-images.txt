21.11.0 : - upgraded base image to debian:bullseye-slim which implies:
            - python upgraded to 3.9
            - lua updated to 5.4
          - upgraded transfers plugin to mainline version (49e9245b4005) to benefit from build process fixes (no new features)
          - now including the WSI dicomizer tools:
            - /usr/local/bin/OrthancWSIDicomizer
            - /usr/local/bin/OrthancWSIDicomToTiff
            - note that libopenslide has been installed too (use /usr/local/bin/OrthancWSIDicomizer --openslide=libopenslide.so.0 /my/file.svs)
          - the MSSQL commercial plugin has been removed from the image.  
            The orthanc-odbc plugin can now be used with MSSQL server.  However, note that the DB schemas are not compatible and therefore, 
            you need to start a new Orthanc from scratch and copy all data from the old Orthanc to the new one 
            (https://book.orthanc-server.com/users/replication.html#generic-replication).
            Also note that as of today, msodbcsql17 is not available on Debian bullseye, therefore, in order to use Orthanc with MSSQL,
            you should use the 21.10.0-buster image.

            allows for "read-only" containers
          - INTERNAL: install plugins in /run/orthanc/plugins if the directory is
            present, usually with the intent to run a "read-only"
            container with tmpfs mounted on /run or subdirectories
          - INTERNAL: load plugins from /run/orthanc/plugins in addition to
            /usr/share/orthanc/plugins; a warning is currently issued if
            the directory doesn't exist and can be ignored
          - INTERNAL: /usr/share/orthanc/plugins-disabled renamed to
            /usr/share/orthanc/plugins-available; a symbolic link is
            left behind for backward-compatibility
          - INTERNAL: compatibility warning: any build processes which may rely on
            "enabled" plugins to be unlinked from the plugins-disabled
            directory need to be updated and assume the semantics of the
            plugins-available directory

            doing and that this API route is protected from the outside world or secured by another mean.

            and will display a warning in the Orthanc Explorer stating that your setup is insecure.
            If you decide to set AC_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED to false, make sure that you know what you're
            doing and that your Orthanc is either not accessible from the outside world or secured by another mean.
