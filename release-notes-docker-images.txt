Starting from the 22.6.1 release, we are providing 2 types of images:
  - the default image with the usual tag: e.g 22.6.1
  - the full image with a e.g 22.6.1-full tag
The default image is suitable for 99.9% of users.
You should use the full image only if you need to use one of these:
  - the Azure Blob storage plugin
  - the Google Cloud storage plugin
  - the ODBC plugin with SQL Server (msodbcsql18 is preinstalled)
Only the default tags are listed here.  You just need to append `-full` for the full image.

          - upgraded Orthanc Explorer 2 plugin to 1.0.2
          - Added a new special env var: ORTHANC__OHIF to define the "OHIF" configuration in one go.
            Also added 4 non standard env vars for OHIF configuration ORTHANC__OHIF__DATA_SOURCE,
            ORTHANC__OHIF__USER_CONFIGURATION, ORTHANC__OHIF__ROUTER_BASE_NAME, ORTHANC__OHIF__PRELOAD

          - During startup, now performing standard env var substitution when reading the 
            configuration files.
23.6.0 :  - POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE:
            Created an 'orthanc' user (uid = 999) and 'orthanc' group (gid = 999) inside the image
            to allow executing the image as a non root user.  The image is still executing as root
            by default but some files/folders ownership have been changed to 'orthanc:orthanc' (they 
            should still be accessible to the root user).  Be extra carefull if you have derived 
            from this image and/or if you were already running as non root.

22.9.2 :  - upgraded advanced authorization plugin to 0.3.0
22.9.1 :  - 2 new environment variables to force the hostid or disable generation of a random one if it is missing.
            DCMTK calls gethostid() when generating DICOM UIDs (used, e.g, in modifications/anonymizations).
            When /etc/hostid is missing, the system tries to generate it from the IP of the system.
            On some system, in particular circumstances, we have observed that the system performs a DNS query
            to get the IP of the system.  This DNS can timeout (after multiple with retries) and, in particular cases,
            we have observed a delay of 40 seconds to generate a single DICOM UID in Orthanc.
            Therefore, if /etc/hostid is missing, we now generate it with a random number (default behaviour).  
            This behaviour can still be deactivated by defining GENERATE_HOST_ID_IF_MISSING=false.  
            The host id can also be forced by defining FORCE_HOST_ID.

            - /usr/local/bin/OrthancWSIDicomToTiff
            - note that libopenslide has been installed too (use /usr/local/bin/OrthancWSIDicomizer --openslide=libopenslide.so.0 /my/file.svs)
          - the MSSQL commercial plugin has been removed from the image.  
            The orthanc-odbc plugin can now be used with MSSQL server.  However, note that the DB schemas are not compatible and therefore, 
            you need to start a new Orthanc from scratch and copy all data from the old Orthanc to the new one 
            (https://book.orthanc-server.com/users/replication.html#generic-replication).
            Also note that as of today, msodbcsql17 is not available on Debian bullseye, therefore, in order to use Orthanc with MSSQL,
            you should use the 21.10.0-buster image.

            possible or copies it otherwise, instead of moving it; this
            allows for "read-only" containers
          - INTERNAL: install plugins in /run/orthanc/plugins if the directory is
            present, usually with the intent to run a "read-only"
            container with tmpfs mounted on /run or subdirectories
          - INTERNAL: load plugins from /run/orthanc/plugins in addition to
            /usr/share/orthanc/plugins; a warning is currently issued if
            the directory doesn't exist and can be ignored
          - INTERNAL: /usr/share/orthanc/plugins-disabled renamed to
            /usr/share/orthanc/plugins-available; a symbolic link is
            left behind for backward-compatibility
          - INTERNAL: compatibility warning: any build processes which may rely on
            "enabled" plugins to be unlinked from the plugins-disabled
            directory need to be updated and assume the semantics of the
            plugins-available directory

          - BREAKING CHANGE: added EXECUTE_LUA_ENABLED settings (default = false).
            This options, when set to false, disables the /tools/execute-script Rest API route.
            If you decide to set EXECUTE_LUA_ENABLED to true, make sure that you know what you're
            doing and that this API route is protected from the outside world or secured by another mean.
            Anyone could execute any code on your machine from this route !
          - BREAKING CHANGE: added AC_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED setting (default = true).  
            It means that you'll need a login/pwd to access orthanc !  These login/pwd shall be defined 
            in AC_REGISTERED_USERS.  If no login/pwd are defined, Orthanc will generate a default user (orthanc:orthanc)
            and will display a warning in the Orthanc Explorer stating that your setup is insecure.
            If you decide to set AC_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED to false, make sure that you know what you're
            doing and that your Orthanc is either not accessible from the outside world or secured by another mean.
            Note that if AC_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED is false, Orthanc Explorer will display a warning stating that your
            setup is insecure.
